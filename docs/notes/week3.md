_22-2-2022 (Week 3)_
Chair: Pepijn Secretary: Alex

## Feedback from TA

### Code of conduct **(Need to submit a new draft by friday 25th)**

- Overall: Lackluster - not complete. Missing details
- Not meeting rubric criteria - need more details (not just answering questions)
- Missing formalities (proper sentences, grammar)
- Keep points specific (SMART goals)
- Missing deliverables apart from code (soft skills, reports etc)
- Mention platform names for delivering (gitlab, brightspace)

### Gitlab best practices going forward

- No minimum amount of issues, but need to be as small as possible
    - Break down tasks into smaller tasks and link them to bigger issues
    - One feature = one issue
- Max 2 people on one issue
- Each issue has description and “done” section
    - “Done” is a checklist of requirements of the feature that need to be implemented to be considered complete
- Need time estimation (milestone) for each issue
- Everyone needs to review and edit merge requests equally and thoroughly
    - For example: pull the branch to local env., and test functionality
- **Merge everything into main by Sunday - that’s when TA checks main branch**
    - Pipeline must be GREEN (important)
- Run checkstyle locally before pushing

## To-do this week

- Make designs/prototype of product
- Do HCI evaluation
- Everyone has project running
- Information literacy
- Everyone can use checkstyle
- Everyone be on time for meetings
- One of each HTTP request type handler on server (API request handler)

    - POST
    - PUT
    - DELETE

- Meeting on campus thursday (time to be decided)
