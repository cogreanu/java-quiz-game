Week 7 notes

Reminder to switch between frontend and backend so everyone has experience in everything. QnA will be at the end to
check everyone knows how to use project, javaFX and Spring.

Alex, Pepijn and Yury are on the list (people who might be at risk) due to not doing as much work in weeks 4/5. These
people should contribute more, by taking up more issues than other members of the group, before the deadline of friday
25/03 to make up for it. This might be done by them taking up more time per issues than other people. Other ways can be
discussed. If a person disagrees with this matter (of not having done enough work in week 4/5 or later) a reply can be
sent to the email with details of why the email is mistaken.

red:
Issue/contribution distribution is still sub par. Distribution of Merge requests is better, but room for improvement.
pipeline sometimes fails, and doesn't get fixed immediately.

yellow:
code reviews are relatively good, some people could do more.

Getting webSockets every 50-100ms should be sufficient. Not to worry about a perfect design, instead make sure it works
reliably and consistently. Everyone should attempt to make new issues, instead of it being a single person. Also
everyone should know about everything that's going on in the project.

Notes:
Chairman did a good job making conctrete points to be addressed, but not enough points and contributions to
discuss/address.

Summary:
pick up slack add more issues (as a group)
