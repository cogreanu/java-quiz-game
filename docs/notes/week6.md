	#Week 5

	We have a rubric from this week forward (traffic light system used)
	### Deadlines this week:
	-	5a
	-	Finish the single player (personal goal)
	### Agreements:
	- Be more active on gitlab 
	-  Maybe set up deadlines for must, could, should haves 
	- Assign issues 
	- Coding needs to be more balanced

	### Things to do or start with this week:
	-	Try to only do the assigned issues 
	-	Write time estimates for the issues
	-	Try to do all assigned issues, and in case that couldnâ€™t be done think about why
	-	Reorganize the issues into a more equal distribution 

	### Feedback: 
	-	Commit size and names are good, style being a bit problematic, lacking documentations,  not what but 		why when writing the documentation
	-	Testing is yellow right now 
	-	Disparity between the group is a bit of a problem , need more merge requests (besides Codrin)
